01Into:
- Create directory named 01Into
- Open this in "Integrated terminal"
- Execute "go mod init hello" -> it will initialize a module named "hello" as well as create go.mod file.
- Create main.go file.
- Write "package main" (on top of file)
- to print the hello world:
    - initialize function with:
        func main(){ fmt.Println("Hello World")}
    - fmt is a package in golang
    - Println is a method
    - adding fmt in function will import "fmt" package (in golang, we don't need to import packages manually)
